CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

• Develop a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card
transactions.
• The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing
class imbalance concerns, and partitioning the dataset into training and testing
subsets.
• Train a classification algorithm—like logistic regression or random forests—to
differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
• Assess the model's efficacy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Additionally, explore strategies like oversampling or undersampling to enhance
outcomes and refine the model's performance.
